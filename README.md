**Open-Source AI Agents** is a Python repository aimed at building the world's largest collection of open-source AI agents for various applications like Dropbox, Notion, Google Drive, Slack, and more. These AI agents use **Llama Index** and **OpenAI** models to perform intelligent actions that integrate seamlessly with a variety of services. The goal is to create an ecosystem where developers and users can easily integrate AI-powered agents into their workflows, automating tasks and boosting productivity. This is being developed by Suhas Bhairav.
